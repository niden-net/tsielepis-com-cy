*Limassol* - **Well-known tax expert, Alexis Tsielepis, has been appointed on the Board of Directors of the Cyprus Theatre Organisation (THOC).**

The Managing Director of Chelco VAT Ltd was appointed on the Board earlier this month following a personal request by Cyprus President, Nicos Anastasiades.

Tsielepis was selected for his professional background and love for the arts.

"When the President calls you in person and honours you with a seat on the Board of the island’s most important cultural vehicle, you can’t say no, and I didn’t want to!" Tsielepis said, adding:

> "Outside of my work, I have always been passionate about music, arts and the theater. Although I have an almost romanticised perception of working with the people of THOC, I am under no delusion that my professional skills will be put to good use in reviewing the current operations and determining the future path of this organization, to make a real difference in THOC and help it grow and prosper."

Tsielepis is widely considered as the foremost expert on VAT in Cyprus. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and a member of the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus (ICPAC). He also holds the Expert in European Value Added Tax (VAT) Degree, which he earned with the highest grade ever awarded in the history of the coveted diploma.

He sits on various committees charged with tax matters, and has authored a number of publications on indirect tax, tax syllabuses and lectures at local and international VAT seminars and conferences.

He had previously served as Vice-Chairman of the Cyprus Grain Commission.

As a semi-government organisation, THOC falls under the supervision of the Minister of Education and Culture of Cyprus and is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors for a thirty-month term of office.

The aims and objectives of THOC are to promote dramatic arts in Cyprus, to cultivate theatrical culture, and to promote artistic relations between the theatre world of Cyprus with those of Greece and other countries.
